        <h1>Mathematics</h1>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p class="definition">
            Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes 
            such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory), 
            formulas and related structures (algebra), 
            shapes and the spaces in which they are contained (geometry), 
            and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis).
        </p>
        <h3>Areas of mathematics</h3>

                <p class="first-paragraph">
                    Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic — 
                    regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry — regarding the study of shapes. 
                    Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly 
                    distinguished from mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra, 
                    which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. 
                    Calculus, consisting of the two subfields infinitesimal calculus and integral calculus, 
                    is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships 
                    between varying quantities (variables).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics 
                    and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion 
                    of new areas of mathematics.

        <h4>Geometry</h4>
        <p>
            Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. 
            It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, 
            such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs 
            of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, the subareas of geometry include:

        <h3>
            Education
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. 
            As a human activity, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes 
            education, careers, recognition, popularization, and so on. In education, 
            mathematics are a core part of the curriculum. While the content of courses varies, 
            many countries in the world teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.
